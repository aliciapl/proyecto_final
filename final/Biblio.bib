abstract="We describe here two new monoclonal antibodies that react with surface antigens of human lymphocytes. Antibody 7.2 identified a determinant on the framework region of the human Ia antigen. It was cytotoxic for all cultured B-cell lines, normal B cells, and monocytes. The antibody was not cytotoxic for normal T cells or for established T leukemic cell lines. In immune precipitation assays, the 7.2 antibody reacted with a bimolecular complex of two chains that resolved in polyacrylamide gels as polypeptides with molecular weights of 29000 and 34000 daltons. These precipitation results were analogous to those achieved with a rabbit antiserum prepared against human Ia antigens. Antibody 9.3 identified a determinant on the framework region of a T-cell antigen. It was cytotoxic for 50--80{\%} of peripheral T cells and for 20--50{\%} of thymocytes. It was not cytotoxic for cultured B-cell lines, normal B cells, or monocytes. In immune precipitation assays, the 9.3 antibody reacted with a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 44000 daltons. Due to the expression of this antigen on a limited subpopulation of human T cells, we have designated the antigen HuLyt-1.",

abstract="B7-H1 is a recently identified member of the B7 family molecules. Upon ligation to its receptors on T cells it regulates activation and differentiation of T cells. B7-H1 preferentially costimulates IL-10 production in resting T cells and further induces the apoptosis of activated T cells. PD-1 is a receptor of B7-H1 and is shown to mediate the inhibition of activated T cell response, presumably by inhibiting cell cycle progression. The expression of B7-H1 protein is limited to macrophage lineage of cells in normal tissues, although its mRNA transcription is found in a broad range of tissues. In contrast, B7-H1 is abundant in various human cancers. The tumor-associated B7-H1 increases apoptosis of antigen specific T cells, leading to growth of immunogenic tumor growth in vivo. Current data suggest that B7-H1 regulates the organ-specific tolerance in normal tissue and may contribute to immune evasion by cancers. Selective manipulation of B7-H1 pathway thus aids in the design of new regimens in the treatment of human autoimmune disease and the control of malignant cancers.",
